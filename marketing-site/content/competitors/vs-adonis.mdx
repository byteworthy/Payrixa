# Upstream vs. Adonis Intelligence: Early Warning vs. Real-Time Alerts

**TL;DR:** Adonis Intelligence provides alerts after claim submission and is deeply integrated with EHR systems like athenahealth, AdvancedMD, and eClinicalWorks. Upstream provides leading indicator monitoring with payment timing detection (DelayGuard), requiring no EHR integration. Upstream is building specialty-specific features for nephrology, dental, family practice, ABA, and imaging  - payment timing and ABA auth tracking coming Q1-Q2 2026. Choose Adonis if you're on a supported EHR and want embedded workflow. Choose Upstream if you need fast implementation (30 days vs 3-6 months), transparent fixed pricing, and leading indicators that catch policy changes before denial rates spike.

## Detailed Feature Comparison

### Payer Intelligence & Monitoring

Both Upstream and Adonis analyze post-submission claim outcomes, but with different cadences and supplementary data:

**Adonis Intelligence** provides real-time alerts (24-48 hours after submission) when denial patterns are detected. Their case study shows detecting a 104% spike in PT denials on day one of a payer rule change appearing in denial data. This rapid notification is valuable for practices that want immediate awareness when denial rates spike.

**Upstream** uses weekly behavioral analysis (DriftWatch™) to detect systemic denial pattern changes, filtering out one-off issues to focus on actionable trends. Upstream includes payment timing monitoring (DelayGuard™) - detecting when payers slow down (e.g., 45 days → 52 days) provides genuine early warning before denial rate changes occur. This leading indicator approach catches policy tightening **before** it shows up in denial rates.

**Bottom line:** Choose Adonis if you want point-in-time alerts. Choose Upstream if you want payment timing as a leading indicator, plus trend analysis that focuses on systemic patterns rather than one-off noise.

### Specialty-Specific Intelligence

**Adonis Intelligence** works across general specialty practices with standard denial detection rules. No specialty-specific features for nephrology ESRD PPS, dental D-codes, family practice E&M patterns, ABA authorization tracking, or imaging prior auth monitoring.

**Upstream** is building specialty-specific features for small to mid-size practices, but these are on the product roadmap (Q1-Q2 2026) and **not yet available**:

**Planned Features (Q1-Q2 2026):**
- **Nephrology Groups:** Dialysis ESRD PPS bundle tracking, CKD stage coding monitoring - **Q2 2026**
- **Dental Practices:** D-code frequency limit tracking, periodontal maintenance patterns - **Q2 2026**
- **Family Practice Groups:** E&M level coding shift detection, preventive care denial patterns - **Q2 2026**
- **ABA Therapy Clinics:** Authorization expiration alerts (30-day advance notice) - **Q1 2026 priority**
- **Imaging Centers:** Prior authorization approval rate tracking, RBM pattern monitoring - **Q2 2026**

**Current Reality:** Both products currently analyze general denial patterns on post-submission claims. Upstream's specialty features are differentiated in roadmap/vision, not current functionality.

**Bottom line:** Choose Adonis if you need general denial detection available today. Choose Upstream if you're willing to wait for specialty-specific features (Q1-Q2 2026) and value payment timing monitoring, fast implementation, and transparent pricing in the meantime.

### Implementation & Onboarding

**Adonis Intelligence** requires deep EHR integration, which creates a 3-6 month implementation timeline:
- **EHR dependency:** Requires athenahealth, AdvancedMD, or eClinicalWorks
- **IT resources:** EHR vendor coordination, database access configuration, API setup
- **Timeline variability:** Implementation speed depends on EHR configuration complexity
- **Training:** 2-3 days for staff to learn EHR-embedded workflows
- **Benefit:** Once implemented, Adonis is embedded in existing practice management workflows (no separate login)

**Upstream** is EHR-independent with a fixed 30-day implementation:
- **Week 1:** Kickoff & data connection (clearinghouse feed or CSV upload)
- **Week 2-3:** Specialty-specific rule configuration + staff training (1 day)
- **Week 4:** Testing & go-live
- **No EHR vendor coordination required**
- **Trade-off:** Separate login (not embedded in EHR)

**Bottom line:** Choose Adonis if you prefer EHR-embedded solutions and can wait 3-6 months. Choose Upstream if you need to go live in 30 days or use an unsupported EHR.

### Alert Approach: Reactive vs. Leading Indicators

**Adonis Intelligence** provides reactive denial alerts:
- Alerts trigger after claims are submitted and denials appear
- Detects payer policy changes across their customer base (network effects)
- Customizable alert thresholds
- Embedded in athena/AdvancedMD/eCW only
- **Strength:** Notification when denials spike
- **Limitation:** Reactive - alerts come after claims are already denied

**Upstream** provides leading indicator monitoring:
- **Payment timing monitoring (DelayGuard)** detects when payers slow down (45 days → 52 days) - leading indicator that **precedes** denial rate changes
- DriftWatch™ trend analysis filters out one-off issues, focuses on systemic patterns
- Integrates with any EHR, CRM, and workflow tools
- Authorization expiration tracking (ABA - Q1 2026) provides 30-day advance notice
- **Strength:** Payment timing catches policy changes **before** they show in denial rates
- **Focus:** Actionable trends, not point-in-time noise

**Bottom line:** Adonis alerts after denials spike. Upstream's payment timing monitoring provides early warning **before** denial rates change - genuine leading indicator.

### Integration Approach

**Adonis Intelligence** requires EHR integration:
- Native integration with athenahealth, AdvancedMD, eClinicalWorks only
- Embedded in practice management workflows
- No separate login required
- Edit checking at point of claim creation
- **Strength:** Seamless user experience within supported EHRs
- **Limitation:** Limited to 3 EHR platforms; 3-6 month implementation timeline

**Upstream** works with any system:
- Connects via clearinghouse feeds, CSV uploads, or API
- Works with any EHR or custom PM system
- Integrates with CRM and workflow tools
- Custom integrations available
- **Strength:** Works with any system, 30-day implementation
- **Limitation:** Separate login (not embedded in EHR workflow)

**Bottom line:** Choose Adonis if you're on athena/AdvancedMD/eCW and want embedded workflow. Choose Upstream if you use any other EHR or want flexible integration options.

## Pricing Comparison

### Adonis Intelligence Pricing

- **Model:** Percentage of recovery (ROI-based)
- **Structure:** Variable monthly fees based on denied claims recovered
- **Transparency:** Low - pricing not publicly disclosed, varies by customer
- **Payment Timing:** Monthly billing based on recovery performance
- **Budgeting:** Unpredictable - costs fluctuate with denial volume
- **Total Cost:** Estimated $24,000-$72,000+ annually depending on practice size and denial recovery (percentage typically ranges 10-15% of recovered amounts)

**Hidden costs to consider:**
- Implementation fees may apply depending on EHR
- EHR vendor coordination costs (IT time, potential EHR vendor fees)
- Percentage-based model means higher denial rates = higher costs

### Upstream Pricing
