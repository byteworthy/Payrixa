  "weaknesses": [
    "EHR-dependent implementation creates 3-6 month delays",
    "Pricing opacity - percentage of recovery model not transparent",

    "Practices with IT resources to support 3-6 month EHR integration projects"

  "notIdealFor": [
    "Specialty practices needing dialysis-specific (ESRD PPS), ABA-specific (auth tracking), imaging-specific, or home health-specific intelligence",
