# Objection Handling Guide: Adonis Intelligence

**Last Updated:** January 26, 2026
**Purpose:** Structured responses to common objections when Adonis Intelligence is the competitor

---

## Framework: ACK-REFRAME-BRIDGE-PROVE-ASK

For each objection:
1. **Acknowledge** - Validate the customer's concern (don't dismiss)
2. **Reframe** - Shift perspective to Upstream's strengths
3. **Bridge** - Connect to customer's pain points or goals
4. **Prove** - Provide data, testimonials, or case studies
5. **Ask** - Discovery question to uncover deeper needs

---

## Objection 1: "We already use Adonis and it works fine."

### Acknowledge
"That's great to hear - Adonis is a strong product, especially if you're already integrated with athenahealth, AdvancedMD, or eClinicalWorks. It sounds like they're providing value with real-time alerts."

### Reframe
"What we hear from practices using Adonis is that it's reactive - alerts fire after claims are submitted. That's valuable for quick recovery, but it doesn't prevent the denial from happening. Upstream is proactive - we alert you 2-4 weeks before denials are expected, based on behavioral drift detection. That gives you time to adjust coding, documentation, or workflows before claims go out."

### Bridge
"Let me ask: are you seeing denials that Adonis doesn't catch until after submission? Or denials that you wish you'd known about 2-3 weeks earlier so you could prevent them?"

### Prove
**Case Study:**
"We worked with a 12-station dialysis center in Texas that was using Adonis. They were happy with Adonis's real-time alerts, but still seeing denial rates around 11%. Upstream's early-warning detection caught Medicare Advantage plan changes 3 weeks before their next claim batch - something Adonis never flagged until after submission. They prevented $47,000 in denials in the first quarter."

**Show:** Live demo of early-warning alert (e.g., ESRD PPS comorbidity shift detected 3 weeks early).

### Ask
1. "How long have you been using Adonis? What's been working well, and what's been frustrating?"
2. "How long did it take to implement Adonis? [Listen for 3-6 months] We're live in 30 days. Would faster implementation have helped back then?"
3. "What's your current denial rate for [dialysis / ABA / imaging / home health] claims? [Listen for 8-15%+] Would early-warning prevention help you get closer to the 6-8% industry benchmark?"
4. "Have you considered running Upstream and Adonis in parallel? Many of our customers started that way - Adonis for real-time alerts, Upstream for early-warning prevention. Over time, they found Upstream caught more issues and canceled Adonis. Would you be open to a trial?"

### Close
"How about this: let's run a 60-day trial of Upstream alongside Adonis. If Upstream catches issues Adonis doesn't, we'll talk about whether you still need both. If Adonis is catching everything, no harm done. Fair?"

---

## Objection 2: "Adonis integrates with our EHR. Does Upstream?"

### Acknowledge
"You're absolutely right - Adonis has deep integrations with athenahealth, AdvancedMD, and eClinicalWorks. That's a core strength of their product, and it's valuable to have alerts embedded in your EHR workflow."

### Reframe
"Upstream is intentionally EHR-independent. That allows us to go live in 30 days instead of 3-6 months, and work with any EHR - not just those three. You'll log into a separate Upstream dashboard, which means one extra click, but you get specialty-specific intelligence that Adonis doesn't offer."

### Bridge
"The trade-off is speed vs. embedding. With Adonis, you wait 3-6 months for embedded alerts. With Upstream, you're live in 30 days with a separate dashboard. What's more important to you: having alerts embedded in your EHR, or getting [dialysis ESRD PPS / ABA authorization tracking / imaging prior auth / home health OASIS]-specific intelligence fast?"

### Prove
**Customer Quote:**
"We worked with a 25-BCBA ABA therapy clinic that was frustrated with Adonis's 4-month EHR integration timeline. They switched to Upstream and were live in 30 days. The clinical director said: *'The separate login is a small inconvenience compared to the ABA-specific authorization tracking we get. Adonis's general rules didn't catch authorization expirations until claims were denied. Upstream alerts us 2 weeks before expirations.'*"

**Show:** Live demo of Upstream dashboard (clean, intuitive, mobile-friendly).

### Ask
1. "Are you on athenahealth, AdvancedMD, or eClinicalWorks? [If no] Then Adonis won't work for you - they only integrate with those three. Upstream works with any EHR."
2. "How long did that EHR integration take with Adonis? [Listen for 3-6 months] Would you rather wait that long for embedded alerts or go live in 30 days with a separate dashboard?"
3. "How often do your staff need to access payer intelligence? [If daily] They'll log in once per day to Upstream. [If weekly] They'll log in once per week. Is that an acceptable trade-off for [dialysis / ABA / imaging / home health]-specific intelligence?"
4. "What if we could prove that Upstream's separate dashboard actually saves time because the alerts are more actionable? Would you be open to a demo?"

### Close
"Most of our customers find that Upstream's specialty-specific intelligence outweighs the inconvenience of a separate login. Would you be open to seeing a demo of our [dialysis / ABA / imaging / home health]-specific rules? If the intelligence is valuable enough, the separate login becomes a non-issue."

---

## Objection 3: "What makes Upstream different from Adonis?"

### Acknowledge
"Great question - both products monitor payer behavior and alert you to denial risks, so I understand why they might seem similar at first glance. Let me clarify the key differences."

### Reframe (use SNAP framework)

**Situation:**
"Adonis provides real-time alerts the moment claims are submitted. That's valuable if you want to react quickly and appeal denials as soon as they happen."

**Need:**
"But what we hear from [dialysis / ABA / imaging / home health] practices is that by the time Adonis alerts you, the claim is already out the door. You can't prevent the denial - you can only appeal or adjust future claims. And Adonis treats all specialties the same - no custom rules for dialysis ESRD PPS, ABA authorization tracking, imaging prior auth, or home health OASIS."

**Action:**
"Upstream does three things differently:
1. **Early-warning alerts** - We detect payer behavioral changes 2-4 weeks before denials appear, giving you time to adjust before submission.
2. **Specialty-specific intelligence** - Custom rules for dialysis, ABA, imaging, and home health (not general rules).
3. **30-day implementation** - We're live in 30 days with transparent fixed pricing (vs. 3-6 months EHR integration and variable percentage-based pricing)."

**Payoff:**
"Our [dialysis / ABA / imaging / home health] customers see 20-35% fewer denials after implementing Upstream because they're catching payer changes earlier. Would preventing denials before submission be valuable for your practice?"

### Bridge
"The biggest difference is philosophy: Adonis is recovery-focused (react quickly after submission). Upstream is prevention-focused (catch issues before submission). Which aligns better with your goals?"

### Prove
**Case Study:**
"Let me give you a concrete example. A dialysis center in Texas was using Adonis and saw a Medicare Advantage plan start denying claims with certain comorbidity codes. Adonis alerted them the day claims were submitted - too late to prevent the denials. They switched to Upstream, and we detected the same payer tightening comorbidity approval 3 weeks before their next claim batch. They adjusted coding practices and prevented $47,000 in denials that quarter."

**Show:** Side-by-side demo of Adonis's real-time alerts vs. Upstream's early-warning behavioral drift detection.

### Ask
1. "Would you rather prevent denials before submission or recover them quickly after?"
2. "How important is specialty-specific intelligence for [dialysis / ABA / imaging / home health] vs. general payer intelligence?"
3. "What's your timeline for going live? Do you need something in 30 days or can you wait 3-6 months for EHR integration?"
4. "What's more important to your CFO: transparent fixed pricing or variable percentage-based pricing?"

### Close
"Can I show you an example of how Upstream detected [ESRD PPS change / ABA auth expiration / imaging prior auth shift] 3 weeks before denials appeared? That's something Adonis can't do because they alert at submission, not before."

---

## Objection 4: "Adonis gives us real-time alerts. Does Upstream?"

### Acknowledge
"You're right - Adonis's real-time alerts at submission are a core strength. That's not what Upstream does, and I want to be transparent about that."

### Reframe
"Upstream alerts you 2-4 weeks BEFORE denials are expected, not at the moment of submission. That's by design - we're prevention-focused, not recovery-focused. Think of it this way:
- **Adonis:** Tells you when the house is on fire (real-time alert at submission)
- **Upstream:** Tells you when the smoke detector starts smelling smoke (early-warning alert before submission)

Both are valuable, but prevention saves more money because you avoid the denial entirely."

### Bridge
"Let me ask: would you rather prevent denials before submission or react quickly after submission? Most of our customers prefer prevention because it's less work (no appeals, no resubmissions) and higher margin (100% of revenue collected vs. 60-80% on appeals)."

### Prove
**Customer Quote:**
"We worked with an ABA therapy clinic that was using Adonis for real-time alerts. They told us: *'Adonis would alert us the day authorization expirations caused denials, but by then it was too late to renew the authorization. Upstream alerts us 2 weeks before expirations, so we can renew proactively. We've reduced authorization-related denials by 40% in 90 days.'*"

**Show:** Live demo of Upstream's early-warning alert timeline (3 weeks before denial vs. Adonis's real-time alert at submission).

### Ask
1. "How many denials are you currently appealing each month? [Listen for 50-200+] What if you could prevent 20-35% of those before submission?"
2. "What's the cost of appeals (staff time + success rate)? [Listen for 30-50% overhead] Would prevention be more efficient?"
3. "Have you considered running Upstream for early-warning prevention and Adonis for real-time alerts in parallel? Many of our customers started that way and eventually found Upstream's prevention reduced the need for Adonis's reactive alerts."

### Close
"How about this: let's run Upstream and Adonis in parallel for 60 days. If Upstream's early-warning alerts prevent more denials than Adonis's real-time alerts recover, we'll talk about replacing Adonis. If Adonis is more valuable, we'll position Upstream as a complement. Fair?"

---

## Objection 5: "We don't want to switch - too much hassle."

### Acknowledge
"I completely understand - switching vendors is disruptive, especially if Adonis is already integrated with your EHR. Change management is real, and I don't want to add unnecessary complexity to your operations."

### Reframe
"Good news: you don't have to switch. Upstream can run in parallel with Adonis. Many of our customers started that way:
- **Adonis:** Real-time alerts at submission for immediate action
- **Upstream:** Early-warning prevention for proactive denial avoidance

Over time, they found Upstream caught issues Adonis missed, and eventually canceled Adonis. But there's no requirement to switch - we can complement each other."

### Bridge
"The bigger question is: are you losing revenue to denials that Adonis isn't catching? If so, adding Upstream for early-warning prevention could be valuable even if you keep Adonis. It's not 'replace Adonis' - it's 'add Upstream for prevention.'"

### Prove
**Case Study:**
"We worked with a dialysis center that didn't want to cancel Adonis mid-contract. They ran Upstream in parallel for 90 days. Upstream detected ESRD PPS changes 3 weeks before Adonis alerted (at submission). After 90 days, they realized Upstream's prevention was more valuable than Adonis's recovery, and they canceled Adonis at renewal. But they didn't have to switch on day one."

**Show:** Parallel operation diagram (Upstream + Adonis side-by-side).

### Ask
1. "What's your current denial rate for [dialysis / ABA / imaging / home health] claims? [Listen for 8-15%+] Industry benchmark is 6-8%. If you're above that, would early-warning prevention help you get closer to benchmark?"
2. "How much are you losing annually to denials? [Calculate: monthly claims × denial rate × 12] If Upstream could reduce that by 20-35%, what would that be worth?"
3. "When is your Adonis contract up for renewal? [Listen for 6-12 months] Would you be open to running Upstream in parallel until then, so you can compare performance before renewal?"
4. "What would it take for you to consider adding (not replacing) Upstream for early-warning prevention?"

### Close
"How about this: let's run a 60-day trial of Upstream alongside Adonis. No switching required - just add Upstream for early-warning prevention. If Upstream catches issues Adonis doesn't, we'll talk about what that means for your Adonis renewal. If Adonis is catching everything, no harm done. Fair?"

---

## Objection 6: "How much does Upstream cost compared to Adonis?"

### Acknowledge
"That's a fair question - pricing is a key decision factor. Let me walk you through the comparison."

### Reframe (emphasize transparency vs. opacity)
"Adonis uses a percentage-based recovery model - typically 10-15% of denied claims recovered, though they don't disclose pricing publicly. That means your costs fluctuate every month based on denial volume. Upstream uses transparent fixed monthly pricing: [$1,500 / $3,500 / custom] per month, every month. Your CFO can budget accurately."

### Bridge
"The question isn't just 'which is cheaper?' It's 'which provides better value?' Let me show you the math for a practice your size."

### Prove (show cost comparison scenarios)

**Small Dialysis Center (5-10 stations):**
- **Upstream:** $1,500/month = $18,000/year (fixed)
- **Adonis:** $2,000-$3,500/month = $24,000-$42,000/year (variable, estimated)
- **Savings with Upstream:** $6,000-$24,000/year (25-40% lower)

**Medium ABA Therapy Clinic (15-25 BCBAs):**
- **Upstream:** $3,500/month = $42,000/year (fixed)
- **Adonis:** $4,000-$6,000/month = $48,000-$72,000/year (variable, estimated)
- **Savings with Upstream:** $6,000-$30,000/year (15-40% lower)

**Plus: ROI from Prevention**
"That's just the cost comparison. The real value is ROI from prevention. If Upstream reduces your denials by 25-35% through early-warning detection, that's [$100k-$250k] in annual savings for a practice your size. Upstream pays for itself 4-6x in year one."

### Ask
1. "What percentage of recovered denials are you paying Adonis today? [Listen for 10-15% or 'I don't know'] Do you know what that translates to in annual costs?"
2. "Do your monthly costs with Adonis fluctuate based on denial volume? [Likely 'yes'] Would your CFO prefer predictable fixed costs?"
3. "What's your current monthly spend with Adonis? [Compare to Upstream pricing] If Upstream is [15-40%] lower and provides specialty-specific intelligence, would that be valuable?"
4. "What would it take for your CFO to approve Upstream? Do they need a business case showing ROI?"

### Close
"Let me send you a customized ROI analysis for your practice size and specialty. I'll show you:
1. Upstream's fixed monthly cost vs. Adonis's estimated variable cost
2. ROI from preventing denials (based on your current denial rate)
3. Total cost of ownership over 3 years

Would that help you make a decision? Can we schedule 30 minutes next week to review it with your CFO?"

---

## Objection 7: "Adonis is already embedded in our workflow. We don't want a separate tool."

### Acknowledge
"I understand - adding a separate tool means one more login, and that can feel like friction for staff who are already stretched thin."

### Reframe
"Let me reframe that: Adonis is embedded in your EHR, which is convenient. But Upstream's specialty-specific intelligence is so much deeper than Adonis's general rules that most of our customers find the separate login is worth it. Think of it this way:
- **Adonis:** Convenient (embedded) but generic (general rules)
- **Upstream:** One extra click (separate login) but custom (specialty-specific rules)

Which is more valuable: convenience or intelligence?"

### Bridge
"Let me ask: if Upstream could prevent 20-35% more denials than Adonis because of our [dialysis ESRD PPS / ABA authorization tracking / imaging prior auth / home health OASIS]-specific intelligence, would your staff be willing to log in separately? Or is the embedded workflow so critical that you'd sacrifice that prevention?"

### Prove
**Customer Quote:**
"We worked with an imaging center that was hesitant about a separate login. The CFO told us: *'After 30 days with Upstream, our staff stopped complaining about the separate login because the prior authorization pattern alerts were so much more accurate than Adonis's generic rules. They log in once per day, review 5-10 targeted alerts, and move on. It's actually faster than Adonis's noisy alerts.'*"

**Show:** Mobile-friendly Upstream dashboard (can check alerts on phone in 2 minutes).

### Ask
1. "How often do your staff need to access payer intelligence? [If daily] They'll log in once per day to Upstream. Is that an acceptable trade-off for [dialysis / ABA / imaging / home health]-specific intelligence?"
2. "How many alerts does Adonis generate per day? [Listen for 20-50+] Are they noisy (lots of false positives)? Upstream's specialty-specific rules generate fewer, more targeted alerts - would that save time even with a separate login?"
3. "What if we could prove that Upstream's separate dashboard actually saves time because the alerts are more actionable? Would you be open to a 30-day trial?"

### Close
"How about this: let's run a 30-day trial with 2-3 of your staff. If they find the separate login too much friction, we'll acknowledge that Adonis's embedding is more valuable. If they find Upstream's specialty-specific intelligence outweighs the inconvenience, we'll talk about expanding. Fair?"

---

## Objection 8: "We're mid-contract with Adonis. We can't switch now."

### Acknowledge
"That makes sense - honoring your contract commitments is important, and I respect that. Switching vendors mid-contract can be expensive and disruptive."

### Reframe
"Good news: you don't have to switch now. We can run Upstream in parallel with Adonis until your contract renewal. Many of our customers started that way - Adonis for real-time alerts, Upstream for early-warning prevention. By the time their Adonis contract came up for renewal, they had data showing which product caught more issues."

### Bridge
"The question is: when is your Adonis renewal? If it's 6-12 months out, would you rather wait until then to explore Upstream, or start running Upstream now so you have data to make a decision at renewal?"

### Prove
**Case Study:**
"We worked with a dialysis center that was 8 months into a 2-year Adonis contract. They ran Upstream in parallel for the remaining 16 months. By renewal time, they had clear data: Upstream detected ESRD PPS changes 3 weeks earlier than Adonis, prevented $150k in denials, and cost 30% less annually. They canceled Adonis at renewal and went all-in on Upstream."

**Show:** Parallel operation diagram (Upstream + Adonis side-by-side during transition).

### Ask
1. "When is your Adonis contract up for renewal? [Listen for 6-24 months]"
2. "What would it take for you to decide NOT to renew Adonis? [Listen for: cost savings, better intelligence, faster implementation]"
3. "Would you be open to running Upstream in parallel for [X months until renewal] so you have data to compare performance?"
4. "What metrics would you track during that parallel period to decide which to keep? (Denial rate reduction, alert accuracy, staff satisfaction, cost savings)"

### Close
"How about this: let's run Upstream in parallel with Adonis until your renewal date. We'll track:
1. Denial rate reduction (Upstream's early-warning prevention vs. Adonis's real-time alerts)
2. Alert accuracy (false positives, true positives, missed denials)
3. Cost comparison (Upstream's fixed pricing vs. Adonis's variable percentage)
4. Staff satisfaction (which tool is more actionable)

By renewal time, you'll have clear data to make a decision. If Upstream wins, you cancel Adonis. If Adonis wins, you cancel Upstream. Fair?"

---

## Summary: Top 3 Objections & Rapid Responses

### 1. "We already use Adonis and it works fine."
**Rapid response:** "Great - Adonis is reactive (alerts after submission). Upstream is proactive (alerts 2-4 weeks before denials). Many customers run both in parallel and find Upstream's prevention reduces the need for Adonis's recovery. Want to try a 60-day parallel trial?"

### 2. "Adonis integrates with our EHR. Does Upstream?"
**Rapid response:** "Adonis requires 3-6 months for EHR integration. Upstream is live in 30 days with a separate login. Trade-off: speed + specialty intelligence vs. embedding. What's more important: fast implementation or embedded alerts?"

### 3. "What makes Upstream different from Adonis?"
**Rapid response:** "Three things: (1) Early-warning alerts 2-4 weeks before denials (vs. real-time at submission), (2) Specialty-specific intelligence for dialysis/ABA/imaging/home health (vs. general rules), (3) 30-day implementation + transparent pricing (vs. 3-6 months + variable percentage). Want a demo?"
