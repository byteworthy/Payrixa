## ROI from Prevention (Upstream's Core Value)

### Denial Rate Reduction Through Early-Warning Prevention

**Industry benchmarks:**
- Dialysis: 11.8% denial rate (national average)
- ABA therapy: 15% denial rate (national average)
- Imaging: 9% denial rate (national average)
- Home health: 12% denial rate (national average)

**Upstream's prevention impact:**
- **Early-warning detection:** 2-4 weeks before denials appear
- **Behavioral drift tracking:** Longitudinal analysis of payer patterns
- **Specialty-specific rules:** Custom intelligence for dialysis, ABA, imaging, home health
- **Denial reduction:** 20-35% reduction in denial rate (based on customer data)

---

## Talking Points for CFO/Owner Conversations

### 1. Predictable Budgeting (Fixed vs. Variable Pricing)

**Upstream:**
*"Upstream costs [$1,500 / $3,500 / custom] per month, every month. Your annual RCM technology budget is [$18,000 / $42,000 / custom]. No surprises, no fluctuations. You can forecast accurately for board approval."*

**Adonis:**
*"Adonis charges a percentage of your recovered denials - typically 10-15%, though they don't disclose pricing publicly. That means your costs fluctuate every month based on denial volume. If denials spike, your Adonis bill spikes. If denials drop, your bill drops. That makes budgeting difficult."*

**CFO preference:** Fixed monthly costs (Upstream) > Variable percentage-based costs (Adonis)

---

### 2. Total Cost of Ownership (3-Year View)

**Upstream (3-year TCO):**
- Year 1: $18,000-$84,000 (depending on size)
- Year 2: $18,000-$84,000
- Year 3: $18,000-$84,000
- **Total:** $54,000-$252,000 (predictable)

**Adonis (3-year TCO, estimated):**
- Year 1: $27,000-$178,000 (depending on size and denial volume)
- Year 2: $27,000-$178,000 (variable)
- Year 3: $27,000-$178,000 (variable)
- **Total:** $81,000-$534,000 (unpredictable)

**Savings with Upstream:** $27,000-$282,000 over 3 years (17-53% lower)

**CFO takeaway:** Upstream's 3-year TCO is 17-53% lower and predictable.

---

### 3. ROI from Prevention (Not Just Cost Savings)

**Talking point:**
*"The real value isn't just cost savings on the platform fee. It's the ROI from preventing denials before submission. If Upstream reduces your denial rate by 25-35% through early-warning detection, that's [$100k-$500k] in annual savings for a practice your size. Upstream pays for itself 4-10x in year one."*

**CFO decision framework:**
- **Upstream cost:** $18,000-$84,000/year
- **Denial prevention savings:** $100,000-$500,000/year
- **Net ROI:** 4-10x in year one
- **Payback period:** 1-4 months

**CFO approval:** When ROI is 4x+ and payback is <6 months, approval is straightforward.

---

### 4. Risk of Variable Pricing (Adonis)

**Talking point:**
*"Adonis's percentage-based model creates a perverse incentive: they make more money when you have more denials. If you reduce denials through better coding or documentation, Adonis's revenue drops. Upstream's fixed pricing aligns with your goal: reduce denials to zero. We make the same revenue whether you have 100 denials or 10 denials."*

**CFO concern:** Vendor misalignment (Adonis benefits from high denials) vs. alignment (Upstream benefits from your success)

---

### 5. Implementation Speed = Faster ROI

**Talking point:**
*"Adonis requires 3-6 months for EHR integration. That's 3-6 months of lost revenue while you wait to go live. Upstream is live in 30 days. If you're losing [$50k-$200k] per month to preventable denials, every month you wait costs you money. Would you rather start seeing ROI in 30 days or 3-6 months?"*

**CFO math:**
- **Upstream:** 30-day implementation = ROI starts month 2
- **Adonis:** 3-6 month implementation = ROI starts month 4-7
- **Opportunity cost:** 3-5 months of denied revenue ([$150k-$1M] for dialysis centers)

**CFO preference:** Faster ROI (Upstream) > Delayed ROI (Adonis)

---

## Sales Scripts for Cost/ROI Conversations

### Script 1: Cost Comparison (Transparent vs. Opaque)

**Setup:** CFO asks, "How much does Upstream cost compared to Adonis?"

**Response:**
*"Great question. Upstream costs [$1,500 / $3,500 / custom] per month - that's [$18,000 / $42,000 / custom] per year, fixed. Adonis charges a percentage of your recovered denials - typically 10-15%, though they don't disclose pricing publicly. Based on your denial volume, Adonis would cost approximately [$X-$Y] per year, but it fluctuates monthly. Upstream is typically 15-40% lower in annual cost and provides predictable budgeting. Does fixed pricing help with your approval process?"*

---

### Script 2: ROI from Prevention (CFO Decision Framework)

**Setup:** CFO says, "I need to see the ROI to justify this investment."

**Response:**
*"Absolutely. Let me walk you through the math. Your current denial rate is [11.8% for dialysis / 15% for ABA / 9% for imaging / 12% for home health]. That's [$X] in annual denials. If Upstream reduces your denials by 25-35% through early-warning detection, that's [$Y-$Z] in annual savings. Upstream costs [$A] per year. That's a [4-10x] ROI in year one, with a [1-4 month] payback period. Does that ROI meet your approval threshold?"*

---

### Script 3: Upstream + Prevention Value > Adonis + Recovery Value

**Setup:** CFO says, "Adonis's percentage-based pricing means we only pay for results."

**Response:**
*"That's a fair point - Adonis only gets paid when they recover denials. But here's the key difference: Upstream prevents denials before submission, so there's nothing to recover. Which is more valuable: recovering 50-70% of a denial through appeals (Adonis's model), or preventing the denial entirely (Upstream's model)? Prevention is 100% margin - no appeals, no resubmissions, no staff time. Recovery is 50-70% margin with appeals overhead. Would you rather prevent denials or recover them?"*

---

### Script 4: Total Cost of Ownership (3-Year View)

**Setup:** CFO asks, "What's the 3-year TCO?"

**Response:**
*"Over 3 years, Upstream costs [$54k-$252k] (depending on your practice size), fixed and predictable. Adonis costs an estimated [$81k-$534k] over 3 years, but it's variable based on denial volume. Upstream's 3-year TCO is 17-53% lower and provides budget certainty. Plus, if Upstream reduces your denials by 25-35%, you're saving [$300k-$1.5M] over 3 years through prevention. That's a [5-10x] ROI over 3 years. Does that TCO work for your budget?"*

---

## Summary: Cost & ROI Positioning vs. Adonis

**Key messages:**
1. **Lower cost:** Upstream is typically 15-40% lower in annual cost (fixed pricing vs. variable percentage)
2. **Predictable budgeting:** Fixed monthly fee (Upstream) vs. fluctuating percentage-based fee (Adonis)
3. **Higher ROI:** 4-10x ROI from denial prevention (Upstream) vs. recovery-only ROI (Adonis)
4. **Faster payback:** 1-4 month payback (Upstream) vs. 3-6 month implementation delay (Adonis)
5. **Alignment:** Upstream benefits when you succeed (fixed fee regardless of denials) vs. Adonis benefits from high denials (percentage of recovery)

**CFO decision:** When Upstream is lower cost + higher ROI + faster payback + aligned incentives, approval is straightforward.
