## Pricing Model

### Launch Pricing (Months 1-6)

**Strategy:** Aggressive market entry pricing to beat Adonis on cost

| Tier | Monthly Price | Target Customer | Features |
|------|---------------|----------------|----------|
| **Starter** | $299 | 1 location, <500 claims/month | Real-time detection, Calendar alerts, Basic automation |
| **Professional** | $599 | 2-3 locations, <2K claims/month | All Starter + Pre-submission scoring, Auto-appeals |
| **Enterprise** | $999 | Unlimited locations/claims | All Professional + Network intelligence, Priority support |

**Value Proposition:** "10x cheaper than Adonis ($5K-15K/month), 90x faster implementation (48 hours vs 6-8 weeks)"

---

### Post-PMF Pricing (Months 7-12)

**Strategy:** Raise prices after proving value + customer lock-in

| Tier | Monthly Price | Change | Justification |
|------|---------------|--------|---------------|
| **Professional** | $999 | +67% | Autonomous execution proven, denial prevention ROI validated |
| **Enterprise** | $2,499 | +150% | Network intelligence delivering 2-4 week early warnings |
| **Enterprise Plus** | Custom ($5K+) | New | White-glove onboarding, dedicated CSM, custom integrations |

**Grandfather Clause:** Existing customers keep launch pricing for 12 months, then +50% annual increase

## Competitive Positioning

### Upstream vs Adonis

| Dimension | Adonis | Upstream |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Pricing** | $5K-15K/month | $299-999/month (launch) |
| **Implementation** | 6-8 weeks | 48 hours |
| **Detection Speed** | 1-2 days (real-time) | 1-2 days + 30-day calendar alerts |
| **Execution** | Manual approval required | Autonomous (pre-approved rules) |
| **Specialty Focus** | General platform | Dialysis, ABA, imaging, home health |
| **Philosophy** | "AI Agents handle tasks, you approve" | "Execute first, notify after" |

**Messaging:** "Adonis tells you what to do. Upstream does it for you."

### Market Segmentation

#### Primary Target (Year 1): ABA Provider Groups

**Why ABA First:**
- 15-30% of ABA clinics have authorization lapse denials
- Average authorization: $6-8K per patient
- 15-20 authorizations lapse per clinic per year
- **ROI:** $120K+ prevented denials per clinic annually

**Pain Points:**
- Manual authorization tracking in spreadsheets
- Surprise denials when auth expires
- High staff turnover = tracking failures

**Messaging:** "Built for ABA Providers - Zero Missed Authorizations Guaranteed"

---

#### Secondary Target (Year 2): Dialysis Centers

**Why Dialysis:**
- Medicare Advantage payment variance (15-20% below Traditional Medicare)
- High claim volume (3-4 sessions/week per patient)
- Complex TDAPA/TPNIES add-on tracking

**ROI:** Recover $50K-100K annually in MA underpayments

**Messaging:** "Track MA Payment Variance Automatically"

---

#### Tertiary Targets (Year 3+):
- **Imaging Centers:** RBM requirement tracking, prior auth automation
- **Home Health:** PDGM compliance validation, recertification alerts

---

**Result:** 90x faster time-to-value

---

### 2. Cost Advantage

**Adonis:** $5K-15K/month
**Upstream:** $299-999/month (launch pricing)

## Competitive Threats & Moats

### Threat: Adonis Lowers Prices

**Mitigation:** Network effects (more customers = faster detection) + autonomous execution (hard to replicate) + specialty focus (ABA-specific features)

### Threat: EHR Vendors Build Native Authorization Tracking

**Mitigation:** Multi-EHR support (works across Epic, Cerner, athenahealth) + cross-payer intelligence (network effects) + autonomous execution (requires payer portal automation)

### Threat: New Entrants

**Mitigation:** First-mover advantage in ABA vertical + customer lock-in via autonomous execution + network effects (data moat)
