# Adonis Intelligence Alternative: Upstream

## Why Practices Look for Adonis Alternatives

Adonis Intelligence is a strong payer intelligence platform with deep EHR integrations and real-time alerts. However, many practices seek alternatives due to:

### 1. EHR Integration Complexity & Delays

Adonis requires full EHR integration with athenahealth, AdvancedMD, or eClinicalWorks, leading to:

- **3-6 month implementation timelines** due to EHR vendor coordination
- **IT resource demands** for integration project management
- **Dependency on EHR vendor support** (delays when vendor is unresponsive)
- **Limited options** for practices on unsupported EHRs or custom PM systems

**What practices need:** Fast implementation without EHR vendor coordination.

### 2. Pricing Opacity & Budgeting Challenges

Adonis uses a percentage-based recovery model:

- **Variable monthly costs** that fluctuate with denial volume
- **Pricing not publicly disclosed** - varies by customer
- **Difficult to budget** accurately for annual RCM technology spend
- **Higher denial rates = higher costs** (counterintuitive incentive structure)

**What practices need:** Transparent fixed monthly pricing for predictable budgeting.

### 3. Limited Specialty-Specific Intelligence

Adonis provides general payer intelligence across multiple specialties but lacks depth in high-complexity verticals:

- **No dialysis-specific rules** for ESRD PPS bundle changes or comorbidity tracking
- **No ABA-specific rules** for authorization expiration or session limit management
- **No imaging-specific rules** for prior auth pattern shifts by CPT code
- **No home health-specific rules** for OASIS documentation or LUPA risk tracking

**What practices need:** Deep specialty-specific intelligence for dialysis, ABA, imaging, and home health.

### 4. Reactive Alerts vs. Proactive Prevention

Adonis alerts fire **after claims are submitted**, providing real-time visibility but limited prevention:

- Alerts catch issues at submission (reactive)
- No early-warning detection of payer behavioral changes weeks in advance
- Recovery-focused (fix after submission) rather than prevention-focused (avoid denials before submission)

**What practices need:** Early-warning behavioral drift detection for proactive prevention.

## Upstream as the Adonis Alternative

Upstream addresses the key gaps in Adonis Intelligence with a prevention-focused, specialty-specific approach:

| Feature | Upstream | Adonis Intelligence |
|---------|----------|---------------------|
| **Implementation Timeline** | 30 days (EHR-independent) | 3-6 months (EHR integration) |
| **Pricing Model** | Transparent fixed monthly subscription | Percentage of recovery (variable) |
| **Specialty Focus** | Custom rules for dialysis, ABA, imaging, home health | General rules across specialties |
| **Alert Timing** | Early-warning (2-4 weeks before denials) | Real-time (at submission) |
| **EHR Dependency** | None (clearinghouse feeds, CSV, API) | High (athena/AdvancedMD/eCW) |
| **Prevention Focus** | Proactive behavioral drift detection | Reactive real-time alerts |

---

## Detailed Comparison: Upstream vs. Adonis

### Implementation: 30 Days vs. 3-6 Months

#### Upstream's 30-Day Implementation

Upstream's EHR-independent architecture eliminates vendor coordination:

**Week 1: Kickoff & Data Connection**
- Initial onboarding call with dedicated specialist
- Connect data feed from clearinghouse or set up CSV upload
- Verify historical claims data visibility

**Week 2-3: Configuration & Specialty Rules**
- Configure specialty-specific rules (dialysis ESRD PPS, ABA auth tracking, imaging prior auth, home health OASIS)
- Set alert thresholds based on practice's denial tolerance
- Train staff on DriftWatch™ and DenialScope™ dashboards

**Week 4: Testing & Launch**
- Test alert delivery (email, in-app, Slack integration)
- Review first batch of early-warning alerts
- Go live with production monitoring

**Fast-track available:** Can go live in 2 weeks for urgent needs.

#### Adonis's 3-6 Month EHR Integration

Adonis requires full EHR integration with vendor coordination:

**Month 1-2: EHR Vendor Coordination**
- Request API access from athenahealth, AdvancedMD, or eClinicalWorks
- Wait for vendor approval and technical documentation
- Coordinate with IT team on integration approach

**Month 3-4: Integration Development & Testing**
- Develop EHR integration with Adonis engineering team
- Test embedded alerts in EHR workflows
- Debug integration issues with EHR vendor

**Month 5-6: Pilot, Training & Go-Live**
- Pilot with subset of users in EHR
- Train staff on EHR-embedded alert workflows (2-3 days)
- Full go-live across practice

**Why the difference?** Upstream connects to data feeds (no EHR integration). Adonis embeds in EHR workflows (requires full integration project).

**Who wins?** If you need to go live in 30-60 days, Upstream wins decisively. If you can wait 3-6 months for embedded EHR workflows, Adonis may be worth the wait.

---

### Pricing: Transparent Fixed vs. Variable Percentage

#### Upstream's Transparent Fixed Pricing

| Practice Size | Monthly Fee | Annual Cost |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Small (1-5 providers)** | $1,500 | $18,000 |
| **Medium (6-20 providers or 5-15 dialysis stations)** | $3,500 | $42,000 |
| **Large (20+ providers or 15+ dialysis stations)** | Custom (~$5,000-$7,000) | $60,000-$84,000 |

**Key advantages:**
- Fixed cost regardless of denial volume
- Predictable budgeting (CFO/owner can forecast accurately)
- No percentage-based fees (you keep 100% of recoveries)

#### Adonis's Variable Percentage-Based Pricing

- **Pricing model**: Percentage of denied claims recovered (estimated 10-15%, not publicly disclosed)
- **Transparency**: Pricing varies by customer
- **Budgeting**: Variable monthly costs based on denial volume

**Estimated costs:**
- Small practice: $2,000-$3,500/month ($24,000-$42,000/year)
- Medium practice: $4,000-$6,000/month ($48,000-$72,000/year)
- Large practice: $6,000-$10,000/month ($72,000-$120,000/year)

**Cost comparison scenarios:**

**Dialysis Center (5-10 stations):**
- Upstream: $18,000/year (fixed)
- Adonis: $24,000-$42,000/year (variable)
- **Savings with Upstream: 25-40%**

**ABA Therapy Clinic (15-25 BCBAs):**
- Upstream: $42,000/year (fixed)
- Adonis: $48,000-$72,000/year (variable)
- **Savings with Upstream: 15-40%**

**Imaging Center (3 locations, 20+ providers):**
- Upstream: $60,000-$84,000/year (fixed)
- Adonis: $72,000-$120,000/year (variable)
- **Savings with Upstream: 10-30%**

**Who wins?** Upstream wins on pricing transparency and predictability. Adonis's percentage-based model may align with some ROI approval processes but lacks transparency.

### Specialty-Specific Intelligence

#### Upstream's Specialty-Focused Approach

Upstream is purpose-built for high-complexity specialties with custom rules:

**Dialysis (ESRD PPS):**
- Medicare ESRD PPS bundle change detection
- Comorbidity modifier shift tracking
- MAC policy change alerts for composite rate billing
- Injectable code denial pattern analysis

**ABA Therapy:**
- Authorization expiration tracking across payers
- Session limit change detection
- Medical necessity criteria shift monitoring
- H-code approval pattern analysis

**Imaging Centers:**
- Prior authorization pattern shifts for MRI, CT, PET
- Medical necessity criteria changes by payer
- CPT-specific prior auth denial tracking
- Radiology benefit manager (RBM) policy changes

**Home Health:**
- OASIS documentation requirement changes
- Episode timing and LUPA risk factor tracking
- Homebound status interpretation shifts
- Skilled nursing visit frequency pattern changes

**Example:** Upstream detects that a Medicare Advantage plan is starting to deny ABA therapy claims with certain H-codes due to tightened medical necessity criteria. Alerts fire 3 weeks before your next authorization renewal batch, allowing you to adjust documentation proactively.

#### Adonis's General Specialty Coverage

Adonis provides strong general payer intelligence but lacks specialty-specific depth:

- General denial pattern detection across specialties
- Works well for primary care, urgent care, orthopedics, general surgery
- No custom rules for dialysis ESRD PPS, ABA authorization tracking, imaging prior auth patterns, or home health OASIS tracking

**Who wins?** If you're in dialysis, ABA, imaging, or home health, Upstream wins decisively on specialty intelligence. If you're in general specialties, Adonis may be sufficient.

---

### Alert Timing: Early-Warning Prevention vs. Real-Time Reaction

#### Upstream's Early-Warning Behavioral Drift Detection

Upstream's **DriftWatch™** algorithm analyzes longitudinal payer behavior to detect changes **2-4 weeks before denials appear**:

- Tracks subtle shifts in payer approval patterns over time (not just claim-level anomalies)
- Alerts fire *before* claims are submitted, allowing prevention
- Focus on behavioral trends (longitudinal analysis) rather than point-in-time alerts

**Example:** Medicare Advantage plan starts denying dialysis claims with specific comorbidity codes. Upstream detects the trend 3 weeks before your next claim batch and alerts you to adjust coding practices. Denials are prevented entirely.

**Philosophy:** Know what's changing before it costs you.

#### Adonis's Real-Time Alerts at Submission

Adonis provides **real-time alerts** the moment claims are submitted:

- Alerts trigger when claims go to clearinghouse or payer
- Embedded in EHR workflows (athenahealth, AdvancedMD, eCW)
- Immediate visibility into payer responses

**Example:** Physical therapy practice experiences 104% spike in denials. Adonis alerts the day claims are submitted, allowing immediate appeal. (Based on published Adonis case study.)

**Philosophy:** React quickly when denials happen.

#### Key Difference: Prevention vs. Recovery

- **Upstream**: Prevent denials before submission (proactive)
- **Adonis**: Recover denials after submission (reactive)

**Who wins?** It depends on your priority. If prevention is more valuable than speed of recovery, Upstream wins. If you want real-time alerts at submission, Adonis wins.

---

### EHR Integration: Independent vs. Embedded

#### Upstream: EHR-Independent (By Design)

Upstream is intentionally EHR-independent to enable:

- **Fast deployment** (no vendor coordination)
- **Flexibility** across any EHR or custom PM system
- **Lower implementation complexity**

Data connection methods:
- Clearinghouse feeds (most common)
- CSV/Excel uploads
- Custom API connections (enterprise)

**Trade-off:** Separate login required (not embedded in EHR). Staff log into Upstream dashboard for alerts and analytics.

#### Adonis: EHR-Embedded (Core Strength)

Adonis provides deep integrations with major EHR platforms:

- athenahealth: Embedded alerts in Athena workflows
- AdvancedMD: Integrated alerts within AdvancedMD dashboard
- eClinicalWorks: Native eCW integration

**Trade-off:** Requires 3-6 month EHR integration project. Only supports athena, AdvancedMD, and eCW.

**Who wins?** If you're already on athenahealth, AdvancedMD, or eClinicalWorks and want embedded alerts, Adonis wins. If you want EHR-independent deployment, Upstream wins.

---

## Who Should Switch to Upstream

Switch from Adonis to Upstream if you:

1. **Are frustrated with EHR integration delays**: Adonis's 3-6 month implementation is too slow for your needs (Upstream: 30 days)
2. **Need specialty-specific intelligence**: Dialysis ESRD PPS, ABA authorization tracking, imaging prior auth patterns, or home health OASIS tracking (Adonis lacks depth here)
3. **Want prevention before submission**: Early-warning behavioral drift detection is more valuable than real-time alerts after submission
4. **Require transparent pricing**: CFO/owner needs predictable fixed monthly costs (Adonis's percentage-based model is unpredictable)
5. **Use an unsupported EHR**: Not on athenahealth, AdvancedMD, or eClinicalWorks, or use a custom PM system
6. **Limited IT resources**: Cannot support a 3-6 month EHR integration project

**Typical Upstream customer switching from Adonis:**
- Dialysis center frustrated with Adonis's lack of ESRD PPS-specific intelligence
- ABA therapy clinic needing faster implementation (30 days vs. 3-6 months)
- Imaging center requiring transparent fixed pricing for board approval
- Home health agency on unsupported EHR (Adonis doesn't integrate with their PM system)

---

## Who Should Stay with Adonis

Stay with Adonis if you:

1. **Are deeply integrated with athenahealth, AdvancedMD, or eClinicalWorks**: EHR-embedded alerts are critical to your workflow
2. **Strong preference for embedded solutions**: Staff will not use a separate tool (no separate login acceptable)
3. **General specialty practice**: Primary care, urgent care, orthopedics, general surgery (not dialysis/ABA/imaging/home health)
4. **Already completed Adonis integration**: Switching cost is too high (Upstream makes sense for new evaluations, not mid-contract switches)
5. **Real-time alerts at submission are critical**: You need alerts the moment claims go out (Upstream alerts before submission, not at submission)

**Typical Adonis customer who shouldn't switch:**
- Multi-specialty group on athenahealth with deep workflow integration
- Orthopedics practice satisfied with Adonis's real-time alerts and EHR embedding
- Practice with IT resources to manage complex integrations (Adonis's 3-6 month timeline is acceptable)

## Switching from Adonis to Upstream

### Migration Process

**Timeline:** 30 days for Upstream implementation (independent of Adonis cancellation)

**Step 1: Upstream Implementation (Week 1-4)**
- Connect data feed (clearinghouse, CSV, or API)
- Configure specialty-specific rules (dialysis, ABA, imaging, home health)
- Train staff on Upstream dashboards
- Go live with early-warning alerts

**Step 2: Parallel Operation (Optional)**
- Run both Adonis and Upstream in parallel for 30-60 days

- Validate Upstream catches issues Adonis misses (or catches earlier)

**Step 3: Adonis Cancellation**
- Cancel Adonis contract after validating Upstream performance
- No data migration required (fresh start with Upstream's behavioral analysis)

### What Transfers from Adonis to Upstream

**Nothing transfers directly:**
- Adonis alert configurations don't transfer (Upstream uses different methodology)
- EHR integration settings are Adonis-specific (Upstream is EHR-independent)
- Custom workflows in athenahealth/AdvancedMD/eCW are Adonis-specific

**Fresh start with Upstream:**
- Upstream's DriftWatch™ algorithm analyzes historical claims data to establish baseline payer behavior
- Specialty-specific rules are configured from scratch based on your practice's needs
- No "baggage" from Adonis's alert history (start fresh with prevention-focused approach)

### Support During Migration

Upstream provides dedicated onboarding support:

- **Dedicated onboarding specialist** for 30-day implementation
- **Specialty-specific rule configuration** from day one (dialysis, ABA, imaging, home health)
- **Quarterly business reviews** to refine alert rules and optimize performance
- **Direct access to product team** for specialty billing questions

### Cost Savings After Switching

Based on typical practice sizes:

- **Dialysis Center (5-10 stations)**: Save 25-40% annually ($6,000-$24,000/year)
- **ABA Therapy Clinic (15-25 BCBAs)**: Save 15-40% annually ($6,000-$30,000/year)
- **Imaging Center (3 locations, 20+ providers)**: Save 10-30% annually ($12,000-$36,000/year)

**Plus:** Predictable fixed monthly costs (no surprises based on denial volume).

## Customer Testimonials: Practices Who Switched from Adonis

### Dialysis Center in Texas

> "We were on Adonis for 18 months and it worked fine for real-time alerts, but we were still seeing denials pile up. Upstream's early-warning detection caught ESRD PPS changes 3 weeks before our next claim batch, which Adonis never flagged until after submission. The 30-day implementation was a game-changer - no EHR vendor coordination, just plug in and go. We're now catching issues before they cost us."
>
> — *Revenue Cycle Director, 12-station dialysis center*

### ABA Therapy Clinic in California

> "Adonis required a 4-month integration with our EHR, which delayed our go-live. When we switched to Upstream, we were live in 30 days. The ABA-specific authorization tracking is exactly what we needed - Adonis's general rules didn't catch authorization expirations until claims were denied. Upstream alerts us 2 weeks before expirations, so we can renew authorizations proactively."
>
> — *Clinical Director, 25-BCBA ABA therapy clinic*

### Imaging Center in Florida

> "Adonis's percentage-based pricing made budgeting a nightmare - costs fluctuated every month based on denial volume. Upstream's fixed monthly fee lets us forecast accurately. Plus, the prior authorization pattern tracking for MRI and CT is far more detailed than Adonis's general rules. We're seeing 30% fewer prior auth denials since switching."
>
> — *CFO, 3-location imaging center*

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I run Upstream and Adonis in parallel?

Yes. Upstream (early-warning prevention) and Adonis (real-time alerts) serve different purposes and can complement each other during a transition period. Most practices find that Upstream's prevention reduces the need for Adonis's reactive alerts, making Adonis redundant over time.

### Will I lose my Adonis alert history when I switch?

Yes. Adonis alert configurations and history do not transfer to Upstream. However, Upstream analyzes your historical claims data to establish baseline payer behavior and configure specialty-specific rules from scratch. This fresh start eliminates "baggage" from Adonis's alert history.

### How long does the Adonis-to-Upstream migration take?

30 days for Upstream implementation (independent of Adonis). You can run both in parallel for 30-60 days to validate Upstream performance before canceling Adonis.

### Does Upstream integrate with athenahealth, AdvancedMD, or eClinicalWorks like Adonis?

No. Upstream is EHR-independent and connects via clearinghouse feeds, CSV uploads, or APIs (not embedded in EHR). This allows faster implementation (30 days vs. 3-6 months) and flexibility across any EHR. However, you'll need to log into a separate Upstream dashboard (not embedded in EHR like Adonis).

### Is Upstream only for dialysis, ABA, imaging, and home health?

Yes. Upstream is purpose-built for these specialties with custom rules (ESRD PPS, authorization tracking, prior auth patterns, OASIS tracking). If you're in a general specialty (primary care, urgent care, orthopedics), Adonis may be a better fit.

### What if I'm mid-contract with Adonis?

Upstream can be implemented in parallel with Adonis (30 days). Validate Upstream's performance during the parallel period, then cancel Adonis at your contract renewal. Most practices find Upstream's early-warning prevention reduces the need for Adonis's reactive alerts.

### How does Upstream's pricing compare to Adonis?

Upstream uses transparent fixed monthly pricing ($1,500-$7,000/month depending on practice size). Adonis uses percentage-based recovery pricing (typically 10-15% of recovered denials, not publicly disclosed). Upstream is typically 15-40% lower in annual cost and provides predictable budgeting.
