# Upstream vs. Adonis Intelligence

## TL;DR

**Adonis Intelligence** provides real-time alerts on submitted claims, deeply integrated with EHR systems like athenahealth, AdvancedMD, and eClinicalWorks. Strong for practices already on supported platforms, but requires 3-6 months for EHR integration and uses a percentage-based recovery pricing model.

**Upstream** offers early-warning behavioral drift detection before claims are submitted, with specialty-specific intelligence for dialysis (ESRD PPS), ABA therapy (authorization tracking), imaging (prior auth patterns), and home health (OASIS tracking). 30-day implementation with transparent fixed monthly pricing.

**Choose Adonis if:** You're already using athenahealth, AdvancedMD, or eClinicalWorks, need a deeply embedded EHR solution, and are comfortable with 3-6 month integration timelines and percentage-based pricing.

**Choose Upstream if:** You're in dialysis, ABA therapy, imaging, or home health; need fast implementation (30 days); want prevention before submission (not just reactive alerts); and require transparent fixed pricing for budgeting.

## Detailed Feature Comparison

### Payer Behavior Monitoring

Both Upstream and Adonis excel at monitoring payer behavior, but with different approaches and timing:

#### Upstream's Approach: Early-Warning Behavioral Drift Detection

Upstream's **DriftWatch™** algorithm analyzes longitudinal payer behavior over weeks and months to detect subtle shifts **before they result in denials**. This includes:

- **Early-warning signals**: Detects changes 2-4 weeks before denials appear (Rating: 5/5)
- **Behavioral drift tracking**: Tracks approval pattern shifts, authorization requirement changes, and documentation standard tightening over time (Rating: 5/5)
- **Specialty-specific intelligence**: Custom rules for dialysis ESRD PPS bundle changes, ABA authorization expiration tracking, imaging prior auth pattern shifts, and home health OASIS documentation changes (Rating: 5/5)
- **Prevention-focused alerts**: Alerts fire before claims are submitted, allowing you to adjust coding, documentation, or workflows proactively (Rating: 5/5)

**Example:** Upstream detects that a Medicare Advantage plan is starting to deny dialysis claims with certain comorbidity codes 3 weeks before your next batch of claims. You adjust coding practices *before* submitting claims, preventing denials entirely.

#### Adonis's Approach: Real-Time Alerts on Submitted Claims

Adonis provides **real-time alerts** the moment claims are submitted or shortly after, integrated directly into your EHR workflow:

- **Real-time alerts**: Triggers when claims are submitted and payer behavior anomalies are detected (Rating: 5/5)
- **EHR-embedded intelligence**: Alerts appear in athenahealth, AdvancedMD, or eClinicalWorks workflows - no separate login (Rating: 5/5)
- **Claim-level monitoring**: Focuses on individual claim anomalies rather than longitudinal behavioral trends (Rating: 4/5)
- **Edit validation integration**: Works with EHR scrubbing engines to catch errors at claim creation (Rating: 4/5)

**Example:** Adonis detects a 104% spike in physical therapy denials the day claims are submitted and alerts you immediately to investigate and appeal. (Based on published Adonis case study.)

#### Key Difference: Prevention vs. Recovery

- **Upstream's philosophy**: Prevent denials before they happen by detecting payer behavioral changes early. Know what's changing before it costs you.
- **Adonis's philosophy**: Alert you the moment claims go out so you can recover quickly. Real-time visibility into payer responses.

**Who wins here?** It depends on your priority. If prevention is more valuable than speed of recovery, Upstream wins. If you want real-time alerts embedded in your EHR, Adonis wins.

### Specialty-Specific Intelligence

#### Upstream: Built for High-Complexity Specialties

Upstream is purpose-built for dialysis, ABA therapy, imaging, and home health - specialties with complex payer rules and high denial rates:

**Dialysis (ESRD PPS):**
- Tracks Medicare ESRD PPS bundle changes and comorbidity modifier shifts
- Monitors when payers start denying specific injectable codes or comorbidity combinations
- Alerts on MAC policy changes affecting composite rate billing

**ABA Therapy:**
- Tracks authorization expiration dates across multiple payers
- Monitors session limit changes and medical necessity criteria shifts
- Alerts when payers tighten H-code approval patterns

**Imaging Centers:**
- Monitors prior authorization pattern changes for high-cost imaging (MRI, CT, PET)
- Tracks medical necessity criteria shifts by payer
- Alerts on sudden increases in prior auth denials by CPT code

**Home Health:**
- Tracks OASIS documentation requirement changes
- Monitors episode timing and LUPA risk factors by payer
- Alerts on changes to homebound status interpretation

**Rating: 5/5** for specialty-specific intelligence (Upstream's core differentiator)

#### Adonis: General Specialty Coverage

Adonis provides strong general payer intelligence across multiple specialties but does not offer the depth of specialty-specific rules that Upstream provides for dialysis, ABA, imaging, or home health:

- General denial pattern detection across specialties
- Works well for primary care, urgent care, orthopedics, general surgery, PT, OT
- Less focus on niche verticals like dialysis ESRD PPS or ABA authorization tracking

**Rating: 2/5** for specialty-specific intelligence (not a focus area for Adonis)

**Who wins here?** If you're in dialysis, ABA, imaging, or home health, Upstream wins decisively. If you're in general specialties (primary care, urgent care, general surgery), Adonis may be sufficient.

---

### Implementation Speed & Complexity

#### Upstream: 30-Day Implementation (EHR-Independent)

Upstream's EHR-independent architecture allows for fast deployment without vendor coordination:

**Timeline:**
- **Week 1**: Kickoff & data connection (clearinghouse feed or CSV upload)
- **Week 2-3**: Configuration of specialty-specific rules and alert thresholds
- **Week 4**: Testing and go-live

**Requirements:**
- No EHR vendor coordination required
- Minimal IT resources (data connection setup only)
- 1-day staff training

**Fast-track available**: Can go live in 2 weeks for urgent needs.

**Rating: 5/5** for implementation speed

#### Adonis: 3-6 Months (EHR Integration Required)

Adonis's deep EHR integration provides embedded workflows but requires a full integration project:

**Timeline:**
- **Month 1-2**: EHR vendor coordination and API access setup
- **Month 3-4**: Integration development and testing
- **Month 5-6**: Pilot, training, and go-live

**Requirements:**
- Full EHR vendor coordination (athenahealth, AdvancedMD, or eClinicalWorks)
- Significant IT resources for integration project
- 2-3 days staff training on EHR-embedded workflows

**Rating: 2/5** for implementation speed (by design - deep integration takes time)

**Who wins here?** If you need to go live in 30-60 days, Upstream wins. If you can wait 3-6 months for a deeply embedded EHR solution, Adonis's integration depth may be worth the wait.

---

### Real-Time Alerts

#### Adonis: Real-Time Alerts at Submission (Strong)

Adonis excels at real-time alerts the moment claims are submitted:

- Alerts trigger when claims go to clearinghouse or payer
- Embedded in EHR workflow (athenahealth, AdvancedMD, eCW)
- Immediate visibility into payer responses

**Rating: 5/5** for real-time alerts (Adonis's core strength)

#### Upstream: Pre-Submission Alerts (By Design)

Upstream intentionally does NOT provide real-time alerts at submission. Instead, alerts fire **before submission** as early-warning signals:

- Alerts trigger 2-4 weeks before denials are expected (based on behavioral drift detection)
- Focus is prevention, not real-time reaction
- Separate dashboard (not embedded in EHR)

**Rating: 2/5** for real-time alerts (not Upstream's focus - we alert earlier)

**Who wins here?** Adonis wins decisively on real-time alerts. Upstream's philosophy is to alert *before* submission, not at the moment of submission.

---

### EHR Integration

#### Adonis: Deep EHR Integration (Strong)

Adonis provides deep integrations with major EHR platforms:

- **athenahealth**: Embedded in Athena workflows, no separate login
- **AdvancedMD**: Integrated alerts within AdvancedMD dashboard
- **eClinicalWorks**: Native eCW integration for seamless alerts

Adonis's EHR integration is a major strength for practices already on these platforms. Staff don't need to log into a separate tool - alerts appear in their existing workflow.

**Rating: 5/5** for EHR integration depth

#### Upstream: EHR-Independent (By Design)

Upstream is intentionally EHR-independent to enable:

- Fast deployment (no vendor coordination)
- Flexibility across any EHR or custom PM system
- Lower implementation complexity

Data connection methods:
- Clearinghouse feeds (most common)
- CSV/Excel uploads
- Custom API connections (enterprise)

Upstream requires a separate login (not embedded in EHR). This is a trade-off for speed and flexibility.

**Rating: 2/5** for EHR integration (by design - we prioritize speed over embedding)

**Who wins here?** If you're already on athenahealth, AdvancedMD, or eClinicalWorks and want an embedded solution, Adonis wins. If you want EHR-independent deployment, Upstream wins.

## Pricing Comparison

### Upstream: Transparent Fixed Monthly Subscription

Upstream uses a fixed monthly subscription model with transparent pricing:

| Practice Size | Monthly Fee | Annual Cost |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Small (1-5 providers)** | $1,500 | $18,000 |
| **Medium (6-20 providers or 5-15 dialysis stations)** | $3,500 | $42,000 |
| **Large (20+ providers or 15+ dialysis stations)** | Custom pricing (~$5,000-$7,000) | $60,000-$84,000 |

**Key advantages:**
- **Predictable budgeting**: Fixed cost regardless of denial volume
- **Transparent pricing**: Published pricing, no surprises
- **No percentage-based fees**: You keep 100% of recoveries

**Rating: 5/5** for pricing transparency

### Adonis: Percentage of Recovery (Variable, Not Disclosed)

Adonis uses a percentage-based recovery model:

- **Pricing model**: Percentage of denied claims recovered (typically 10-15%, not publicly disclosed)
- **Transparency**: Pricing varies by customer and is not publicly available
- **Budgeting**: Variable monthly costs based on denial volume and recoveries

**Estimated costs** (based on typical recovery percentages):
- **Small practice**: $2,000-$3,500/month ($24,000-$42,000/year)
- **Medium practice**: $4,000-$6,000/month ($48,000-$72,000/year)
- **Large practice**: $6,000-$10,000/month ($72,000-$120,000/year)

**Key considerations:**
- Costs fluctuate with denial volume
- Difficult to budget accurately
- Higher denial rates = higher costs

**Rating: 2/5** for pricing transparency

### Total Cost Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Small Dialysis Center (5-10 stations)

- **Upstream**: $18,000/year (fixed)
- **Adonis**: $24,000-$42,000/year (estimated, variable)
- **Savings with Upstream**: 25-40% lower annual cost

#### Scenario 2: Medium ABA Therapy Clinic (15-25 BCBAs)

- **Upstream**: $42,000/year (fixed)
- **Adonis**: $48,000-$72,000/year (estimated, variable)
- **Savings with Upstream**: 15-40% lower annual cost

#### Scenario 3: Large Imaging Center (3 locations, 20+ providers)

- **Upstream**: $60,000-$84,000/year (fixed)
- **Adonis**: $72,000-$120,000/year (estimated, variable)
- **Savings with Upstream**: 10-30% lower annual cost

**Who wins here?** Upstream wins on pricing transparency and predictability. Adonis's percentage-based model may align with some practices' ROI approval processes, but it's less predictable for budgeting.

## Migration from Adonis to Upstream

### Can Upstream and Adonis Run in Parallel?

Yes. Upstream and Adonis serve different purposes (early-warning prevention vs. real-time alerts) and can complement each other. Many practices run both:

- **Adonis**: Real-time alerts at submission for immediate action
- **Upstream**: Early-warning behavioral drift detection for prevention

However, most practices find that Upstream's prevention-focused approach reduces the need for reactive alerts, making Adonis redundant over time.

### Switching from Adonis to Upstream

If you decide to switch from Adonis to Upstream:

**Timeline:**
- **30 days**: Upstream implementation (independent of Adonis)
- **No downtime**: Run both in parallel during transition, then cancel Adonis

**What transfers:**
- Nothing transfers directly (fresh start with Upstream's behavioral analysis)
- Historical denial data can inform Upstream's initial rule configuration

**What doesn't transfer:**
- Adonis alert configurations
- EHR integration settings
- Custom workflows in athenahealth/AdvancedMD/eCW

**Support offered:**
- Dedicated onboarding specialist configures Upstream's specialty-specific rules from day one
- 30-day implementation ensures you're live quickly
- Quarterly business reviews to refine alert rules and optimize performance

**Cost savings:**
- Switch from variable percentage-based pricing to fixed monthly subscription
- Typical savings: 15-40% lower annual cost (see pricing scenarios above)

## Customer Testimonials

### Dialysis Center Switching from Adonis to Upstream

> "We were on Adonis for 18 months and it worked fine for real-time alerts, but we were still seeing denials pile up. Upstream's early-warning detection caught ESRD PPS changes 3 weeks before our next claim batch, which Adonis never flagged until after submission. The 30-day implementation was a game-changer - no EHR vendor coordination, just plug in and go. We're now catching issues before they cost us."
>
> — *Revenue Cycle Director, 12-station dialysis center in Texas*

### ABA Therapy Clinic Switching from Adonis to Upstream

> "Adonis required a 4-month integration with our EHR, which delayed our go-live. When we switched to Upstream, we were live in 30 days. The ABA-specific authorization tracking is exactly what we needed - Adonis's general rules didn't catch authorization expirations until claims were denied. Upstream alerts us 2 weeks before expirations, so we can renew authorizations proactively."
>
> — *Clinical Director, 25-BCBA ABA therapy clinic in California*

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can Upstream integrate with my EHR like Adonis does?

No. Upstream is EHR-independent by design. This allows for faster implementation (30 days vs. 3-6 months) and flexibility across any EHR or custom PM system. Data connection is via clearinghouse feeds, CSV uploads, or custom APIs - no EHR vendor coordination required.

### Does Upstream provide real-time alerts like Adonis?

No. Upstream provides early-warning alerts 2-4 weeks *before* denials are expected, based on behavioral drift detection. This is intentionally proactive (prevention) rather than reactive (real-time). If you need real-time alerts at submission, Adonis is a better fit.

### Is Upstream only for dialysis, ABA, imaging, and home health?

Upstream is purpose-built for these specialties with custom rules (ESRD PPS, authorization tracking, prior auth patterns, OASIS documentation). If you're in a general specialty (primary care, urgent care, orthopedics), Adonis may be a better fit. Upstream's specialty focus is a core differentiator.

### Can I use both Upstream and Adonis together?

Yes. Upstream (early-warning prevention) and Adonis (real-time alerts) can complement each other. However, most practices find that Upstream's prevention reduces the need for reactive alerts, making Adonis redundant over time.

### How does Upstream's pricing compare to Adonis?

Upstream uses transparent fixed monthly pricing ($1,500-$7,000/month depending on practice size). Adonis uses percentage-based recovery pricing (typically 10-15% of recovered denials, not publicly disclosed). Upstream is typically 15-40% lower in annual cost and provides predictable budgeting.

### What if I'm already on athenahealth, AdvancedMD, or eClinicalWorks?

If you're deeply integrated with these EHRs and want embedded alerts in your existing workflow, Adonis may be a better fit. Upstream requires a separate login (not embedded in EHR). However, Upstream's 30-day implementation and specialty-specific intelligence may outweigh the embedding advantage for dialysis, ABA, imaging, or home health practices.

### Does Upstream support athenahealth, AdvancedMD, or eClinicalWorks?

Upstream connects to data feeds (clearinghouses, CSV uploads, APIs) rather than integrating directly with EHRs. This allows Upstream to work with *any* EHR or custom PM system, including athenahealth, AdvancedMD, and eClinicalWorks - but not embedded in the EHR interface.
