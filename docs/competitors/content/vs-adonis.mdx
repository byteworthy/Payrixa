# Upstream vs. Adonis Intelligence: Early Warning vs. Real-Time Alerts

**TL;DR:** Adonis Intelligence excels at real-time alerts for payer behavior changes detected through claim submission monitoring and is deeply integrated with EHR systems like athenahealth, AdvancedMD, and eClinicalWorks. Upstream focuses on early-warning behavioral drift detection **before** claims are submitted, with specialty-specific rules for dialysis (ESRD PPS), ABA (authorization tracking), imaging (prior auth patterns), and home health (OASIS documentation). Choose Adonis if you're already on a supported EHR and prefer an embedded solution. Choose Upstream if you're in dialysis, ABA, imaging, or home health, need fast implementation (30 days), want transparent pricing, and prioritize prevention over recovery.

## Detailed Feature Comparison

### Payer Intelligence & Monitoring

Both Upstream and Adonis provide payer intelligence, but they approach it differently:

**Adonis Intelligence** monitors payer behavior through claim submission data and generates real-time alerts when policy changes are detected. Their case study shows detecting a 104% spike in PT denials on day one of a payer rule change. This is valuable for practices that want immediate notification when claims hit denial patterns. However, alerts come **after** claims are already submitted, meaning the focus is on recovery rather than prevention.

**Upstream** uses a proprietary DriftWatch™ algorithm to analyze longitudinal payer behavior trends and detect subtle shifts **2-4 weeks before denials appear**. This early-warning approach lets practices adjust coding, documentation, and workflows **before** claims go out, preventing denials rather than reacting to them. The trade-off: Upstream does not provide point-of-submission real-time alerts (by design).

**Bottom line:** Choose Adonis if you need real-time notification at the moment of claim submission. Choose Upstream if you want early warning to prevent denials before they happen.

### Specialty-Specific Intelligence

**Adonis Intelligence** works across general specialty practices but doesn't provide deep vertical intelligence for high-complexity specialties:
- No dialysis-specific ESRD PPS bundle tracking or comorbidity monitoring
- No ABA-specific authorization expiration alerts or session limit tracking
- No imaging-specific prior authorization pattern detection or RBM integration
- No home health-specific OASIS documentation monitoring or PDGM grouper validation

**Upstream** is built from the ground up for four verticals:
- **Dialysis:** ESRD PPS bundle changes, modifier tracking, comorbidity shifts, Medicare Advantage vs. traditional Medicare payment variance monitoring
- **ABA Therapy:** Authorization expiration alerts (6-month cycles), session limit tracking, medical necessity criteria changes by payer
- **Imaging:** Prior authorization pattern shifts by payer/procedure, Radiology Benefit Manager (RBM) integration, AUC compliance tracking
- **Home Health:** OASIS documentation change monitoring, Face-to-Face requirement tracking, PDGM grouper validation, NOA timing alerts

**Bottom line:** Choose Adonis if you're a general specialty practice. Choose Upstream if you're in dialysis, ABA, imaging, or home health and need vertical-specific intelligence.

### Implementation & Onboarding

**Adonis Intelligence** requires deep EHR integration, which creates a 3-6 month implementation timeline:
- **EHR dependency:** Requires athenahealth, AdvancedMD, or eClinicalWorks
- **IT resources:** EHR vendor coordination, database access configuration, API setup
- **Timeline variability:** Implementation speed depends on EHR configuration complexity
- **Training:** 2-3 days for staff to learn EHR-embedded workflows
- **Benefit:** Once implemented, Adonis is embedded in existing practice management workflows (no separate login)

**Upstream** is EHR-independent with a fixed 30-day implementation:
- **Week 1:** Kickoff & data connection (clearinghouse feed or CSV upload)
- **Week 2-3:** Specialty-specific rule configuration + staff training (1 day)
- **Week 4:** Testing & go-live
- **No EHR vendor coordination required**
- **Trade-off:** Separate login (not embedded in EHR)

**Bottom line:** Choose Adonis if you prefer EHR-embedded solutions and can wait 3-6 months. Choose Upstream if you need to go live in 30 days or use an unsupported EHR.

### Real-Time Alerts vs. Early-Warning Detection

**Adonis Intelligence** excels at real-time alerts:
- Alerts trigger within 24-48 hours of claim submission
- Detects payer policy changes across their customer base (network effects)
- Customizable alert thresholds
- Integration with workflow tools (email, Slack, etc.)
- **Strength:** Immediate notification when denials spike
- **Limitation:** Reactive - claims are already submitted

**Upstream** provides early-warning signals:
- Alerts fire **2-4 weeks before denials appear** in claim adjudication
- DriftWatch™ algorithm analyzes longitudinal payer approval patterns
- Detects subtle shifts in authorization requirements, medical necessity criteria, documentation standards
- **Strength:** Proactive prevention (adjust before submission)
- **Limitation:** Does not provide point-of-submission real-time alerts

**Bottom line:** These are complementary approaches. Adonis tells you what's happening now. Upstream tells you what's about to happen.

### EHR Integration

**Adonis Intelligence** has deep EHR integrations:
- Native integration with athenahealth, AdvancedMD, eClinicalWorks
- Embedded in practice management workflows
- No separate login required
- Edit checking at point of claim creation
- **Strength:** Seamless user experience within existing EHR
- **Limitation:** Limited to supported EHRs; implementation depends on EHR vendor

**Upstream** is EHR-independent:
- Connects via clearinghouse feeds, CSV uploads, or API
- Works with any EHR or custom PM system
- No EHR vendor coordination required
- Separate login (standalone web application)
- **Strength:** Faster implementation, works with any EHR
- **Limitation:** Not embedded in EHR workflows

**Bottom line:** Choose Adonis if EHR integration is a must-have. Choose Upstream if you want EHR-independent deployment or use an unsupported EHR.

## Pricing Comparison

### Adonis Intelligence Pricing

- **Model:** Percentage of recovery (ROI-based)
- **Structure:** Variable monthly fees based on denied claims recovered
- **Transparency:** Low - pricing not publicly disclosed, varies by customer
- **Payment Timing:** Monthly billing based on recovery performance
- **Budgeting:** Unpredictable - costs fluctuate with denial volume
- **Total Cost:** Estimated $24,000-$72,000+ annually depending on practice size and denial recovery (percentage typically ranges 10-15% of recovered amounts)

**Hidden costs to consider:**
- Implementation fees may apply depending on EHR
- EHR vendor coordination costs (IT time, potential EHR vendor fees)
- Percentage-based model means higher denial rates = higher costs

### Upstream Pricing

- **Model:** Fixed monthly subscription
- **Structure:** Transparent tiered pricing based on practice size
- **Small Practice (1-5 providers):** $1,500/month ($18,000/year)
  - Includes: DriftWatch, DenialScope, standard support
- **Medium Practice (6-20 providers, 5-15 dialysis stations):** $3,500/month ($42,000/year)
  - Includes: All Small features + specialty-specific rules + priority support + quarterly business reviews
- **Large Practice (20+ providers, 15+ stations):** Custom pricing
  - Includes: All Medium features + multi-site management + dedicated account manager + API access
- **Transparency:** High - published pricing, no hidden fees
- **Budgeting:** Predictable - fixed monthly cost regardless of denial volume

### Cost Comparison Scenarios

**Small Dialysis Center (5-10 stations, 3-5 nephrologists):**
- **Upstream:** $18,000/year (fixed)
- **Adonis:** ~$24,000-$42,000/year (estimated, variable)
- **Difference:** Upstream typically 25-40% lower

**Medium ABA Clinic (15-25 BCBAs):**
- **Upstream:** $42,000/year (fixed)
- **Adonis:** ~$48,000-$72,000/year (estimated, variable)
- **Difference:** Upstream typically 15-40% lower

**Total Cost of Ownership:**
- Upstream: Fixed monthly fee + fast implementation (30 days)
- Adonis: Variable percentage fee + EHR integration costs + longer implementation (3-6 months)

**Bottom line:** Upstream provides predictable budgeting with fixed monthly fees. Adonis's percentage-based model offers alignment with recovery outcomes but less budget predictability.
