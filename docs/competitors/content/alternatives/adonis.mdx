# Adonis Intelligence Alternative: Upstream

Looking for an alternative to Adonis Intelligence? Upstream provides early-warning payer risk intelligence built specifically for dialysis centers, ABA therapy clinics, imaging centers, and home health agencies. Unlike Adonis's EHR-dependent real-time alerts, Upstream detects behavioral drift **2-4 weeks before denials appear**, with 30-day implementation and transparent fixed pricing.

---

## Why People Look for Adonis Alternatives

Practices evaluate alternatives to Adonis Intelligence for several reasons:

### 1. EHR Integration Complexity & Delays

Adonis requires deep EHR integration with athenahealth, AdvancedMD, or eClinicalWorks, leading to:
- **3-6 month implementation timelines** due to EHR vendor coordination
- **IT resource requirements** for database access and API configuration
- **Limited to supported EHRs** - doesn't work if you use a different EHR or custom PM system
- **EHR vendor dependencies** that can block upgrades or workflow changes

**What practices say:**
- "We've been waiting 4 months for Adonis to go live because our EHR vendor keeps delaying the integration"
- "Our EHR isn't supported by Adonis, so we had to look elsewhere"
- "EHR integration required IT resources we don't have as a small practice"

### 2. Pricing Opacity & Budgeting Challenges

Adonis uses a percentage-of-recovery pricing model that creates uncertainty:
- **Variable monthly costs** based on denial recovery volume
- **No published pricing** - requires sales conversation for quote
- **Unpredictable budgeting** - costs fluctuate with denial rates
- **Difficulty getting CFO/owner approval** without transparent pricing

**What practices say:**
- "We couldn't budget for Adonis because costs varied month-to-month"
- "Our CFO needed fixed pricing for board approval, and Adonis wouldn't provide it"
- "The percentage-based model meant higher denial rates = higher costs, which felt backwards"

### 3. Reactive Alerts After Submission (Not Proactive Prevention)

Adonis provides real-time alerts after claims are submitted, but:
- **Alerts come too late** - claims are already out the door
- **Focus on recovery, not prevention** - react to denials rather than prevent them
- **No early-warning signals** - can't adjust coding/documentation before submission

**What practices say:**
- "By the time Adonis alerted us, we'd already submitted 200 claims with the same issue"
- "We wanted to prevent denials before they happened, not just get alerts after"
- "Real-time is good, but early-warning would be better"

### 4. Limited Specialty-Specific Intelligence

Adonis works for general specialty practices but lacks deep vertical intelligence:
- **No dialysis-specific ESRD PPS monitoring** or comorbidity tracking
- **No ABA-specific authorization expiration alerts** or session limit management
- **No imaging-specific prior authorization pattern detection** or RBM integration
- **No home health-specific OASIS documentation monitoring** or PDGM compliance tracking

**What practices say:**
- "Adonis didn't understand dialysis ESRD PPS rules—we needed something specialty-specific"
- "Authorization expirations are the #1 cause of ABA denials, and Adonis doesn't track them"
- "Imaging prior auth patterns change constantly, and Adonis didn't catch them"

## Upstream as the Alternative to Adonis

Upstream provides early-warning payer risk intelligence with a fundamentally different approach:

### Early-Warning Prevention vs. Real-Time Reactive Alerts

| Approach | Adonis Intelligence | Upstream |
|----------|---------------------|----------|
| **When alerts fire** | After claims are submitted (24-48 hours) | Before claims are submitted (2-4 weeks advance) |
| **Focus** | Real-time detection at submission | Early-warning behavioral drift detection |
| **Goal** | Recover denials | Prevent denials |
| **Use case** | "Tell me what's happening now" | "Tell me what's about to happen" |

**Upstream's DriftWatch™ algorithm** analyzes longitudinal payer approval patterns to detect subtle shifts in authorization requirements, medical necessity criteria, and documentation standards weeks before denials appear. This lets you:
- Adjust coding practices before claims go out
- Update documentation templates proactively
- Train staff on new payer requirements in advance
- Prevent denials rather than react to them

### Specialty-Focused vs. General Practice

Upstream is built from the ground up for four high-complexity verticals:

**Dialysis Centers:**
- ESRD PPS bundle change monitoring
- Medicare Advantage vs. traditional Medicare payment variance tracking
- Comorbidity shift detection (affects case-mix)
- Modifier tracking (TDAPA, TPNIES add-on payments)

**ABA Therapy Clinics:**
- Authorization expiration alerts (6-month cycle tracking)
- Session limit monitoring by payer
- Medical necessity criteria changes
- BCBA vs. RBT credential requirement shifts

**Imaging Centers:**
- Prior authorization pattern shifts by payer/procedure
- Radiology Benefit Manager (eviCore, AIM) integration
- CMS Appropriate Use Criteria (AUC) compliance tracking
- Medical necessity documentation requirements

**Home Health Agencies:**
- OASIS documentation change monitoring
- Face-to-Face requirement tracking
- PDGM grouper validation
- NOA timing alerts (losing reimbursement days)

**Bottom line:** If you're in dialysis, ABA, imaging, or home health, Upstream provides the specialty-specific intelligence Adonis doesn't.

### 30-Day Implementation vs. 3-6 Months

Upstream is EHR-independent, eliminating vendor coordination:

**Adonis Implementation:**
- 3-6 months timeline (EHR-dependent)
- Requires athenahealth, AdvancedMD, or eCW
- IT resources for EHR integration
- EHR vendor coordination delays

**Upstream Implementation:**
- **Week 1:** Kickoff & data connection (clearinghouse feed or CSV upload)
- **Week 2-3:** Specialty-specific rule configuration + staff training (1 day)
- **Week 4:** Testing & go-live
- **No EHR vendor coordination required**
- Works with any EHR or custom PM system

**Result:** Go live in 30 days instead of waiting 3-6 months.

### Transparent Fixed Pricing vs. Percentage of Recovery

Upstream provides predictable monthly costs:

| Practice Size | Upstream Monthly Fee | Upstream Annual Cost | Adonis Estimated Annual Cost* |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| **Small Practice** (1-5 providers) | $1,500 | $18,000 | $24,000-$42,000 |
| **Medium Practice** (6-20 providers, 5-15 dialysis stations) | $3,500 | $42,000 | $48,000-$72,000 |
| **Large Practice** (20+ providers, 15+ stations) | Custom pricing | $60,000-$84,000 | $72,000-$120,000 |

*Adonis estimates based on percentage-of-recovery model (10-15% of denied claims recovered). Actual costs vary.

**Upstream pricing includes:**
- DriftWatch™ behavioral drift detection
- DenialScope™ analytics dashboard
- Specialty-specific rules for your vertical
- Quarterly business reviews (all customers, not just enterprise)
- Email, phone, and in-app support
- No hidden costs or recovery-based fees

**Budgeting benefit:** Fixed monthly cost means predictable annual budgeting for CFO/owner approval.

## Who Should Switch to Upstream

Upstream is built for specialty practices needing early-warning prevention and fast implementation:

**Switch to Upstream if you:**
- Are a dialysis center, ABA therapy clinic, imaging center, or home health agency
- Need specialty-specific intelligence (ESRD PPS, authorization tracking, prior auth patterns, OASIS documentation)
- Are frustrated with EHR integration delays (3-6 months for Adonis)
- Use an unsupported EHR or custom PM system
- Need to go live in 30 days instead of 3-6 months
- Want prevention before submission (not just real-time alerts after)
- Require transparent fixed pricing for CFO/owner approval
- Want quarterly business reviews without paying enterprise pricing

**Ideal Upstream customer:**
A 10-station dialysis center on Medicare Advantage contracts experiencing MA payment variances vs. traditional Medicare. They need ESRD PPS monitoring, comorbidity tracking, and early-warning alerts when payers change policies. Adonis's implementation timeline is too long (6 months), and the CFO requires transparent pricing for board approval. Upstream can be live in 30 days with fixed monthly costs.

## Who Should Stay with Adonis

Adonis remains strong for certain use cases:

**Stay with Adonis if you:**
- Are already deeply integrated with athenahealth, AdvancedMD, or eClinicalWorks and satisfied
- Run a general specialty practice (not dialysis/ABA/imaging/home health)
- Strongly prefer EHR-embedded solutions (no separate login)
- Primarily want real-time alerts at the moment of claim submission
- Have IT resources available for 3-6 month EHR integration projects
- Are comfortable with percentage-of-recovery pricing model

**Ideal Adonis customer:**
A 50-provider multi-specialty group (primary care, orthopedics, pain management) on athenahealth. They want real-time alerts embedded in their EHR workflow and are comfortable with a 3-6 month implementation timeline. Percentage-based pricing aligns with their internal approval processes.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I run both Upstream and Adonis together?**
A: Yes. Some practices run both in parallel: Upstream for early-warning prevention (2-4 weeks advance), Adonis for real-time submission alerts. They serve complementary purposes.

**Q: How does Upstream work without EHR integration?**
A: Upstream connects to your claims data via clearinghouse feeds, CSV uploads, or API. We analyze claims data to detect behavioral drift without requiring EHR vendor coordination. This allows for faster implementation (30 days) and works with any EHR.

**Q: I'm on an EHR that Adonis doesn't support. Will Upstream work?**
A: Yes. Upstream is EHR-independent and works with any EHR or custom PM system. We connect via clearinghouse feeds or data uploads, eliminating EHR dependency.

**Q: Is early-warning really better than real-time alerts?**
A: They solve different problems. Real-time alerts (Adonis) tell you what's happening at the moment of submission, which is valuable for immediate response. Early-warning alerts (Upstream) give you 2-4 weeks advance notice so you can prevent denials before claims go out. Prevention is often more cost-effective than recovery.

**Q: What if I'm not in dialysis, ABA, imaging, or home health?**
A: Upstream is built specifically for these four verticals because of their unique payer complexity. If you're in a different specialty, Adonis or other general RCM solutions may be better aligned with your needs.

**Q: How long does it really take to switch from Adonis to Upstream?**
A: 30 days for Upstream implementation. You can evaluate Upstream while Adonis is still running (they don't conflict). If you decide to switch fully, you can cancel Adonis at your contract renewal.

**Q: How do I know if Upstream will work for my practice?**
A: Schedule a demo. We'll show you DriftWatch™ in action with specialty-specific rules for your vertical (dialysis, ABA, imaging, or home health). We can also run a pilot with your claims data to demonstrate early-warning detection before you commit.
