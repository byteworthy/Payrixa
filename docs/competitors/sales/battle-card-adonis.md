# Adonis Intelligence - Competitive Battle Card

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-26
**Competitor:** Adonis Intelligence
**Website:** adonis.ai
**Use Case:** General specialty practices seeking EHR-embedded real-time payer intelligence

---

## Executive Summary (30-Second Pitch)

**When prospects mention Adonis:**

> "Adonis provides strong real-time alerts for practices on athenahealth, AdvancedMD, or eClinicalWorks. **Upstream takes a different approach**: we detect payer behavioral drift **2-4 weeks before denials appear**—giving you time to prevent them, not just react. And we're built specifically for dialysis, ABA, imaging, and home health, with specialty-specific rules Adonis doesn't offer. Plus, we go live in 30 days vs. 3-6 months for Adonis's EHR integration."

## Quick Win Arguments

Use these concise differentiators when time is limited:

| **Upstream Advantage** | **Proof Point** | **Impact** |
|------------------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Early-warning vs. real-time** | DriftWatch™ detects behavioral changes 2-4 weeks before denials appear, not 24-48 hours after submission | Prevent denials instead of reacting to them |
| **Specialty-specific intelligence** | ESRD PPS monitoring for dialysis, authorization tracking for ABA, prior auth patterns for imaging, OASIS for home health | Adonis has general rules; Upstream has vertical-specific intelligence |
| **30-day implementation** | EHR-independent deployment (no vendor coordination) | Go live in 30 days vs. waiting 3-6 months for Adonis EHR integration |
| **Transparent pricing** | Fixed monthly subscription ($1,500-$3,500+) published on website | Adonis uses percentage-of-recovery model (not disclosed), making budgeting difficult |
| **Quarterly reviews for all customers** | Every Upstream customer gets quarterly business reviews, not just enterprise | Adonis reserves QBRs for enterprise; Upstream provides them to everyone |

## Objection Handling

### Objection #1: "We're already using Adonis and it works fine"

**Acknowledge:** "Adonis is a solid product, especially for real-time alerts embedded in your EHR."

**Reframe:** "The question is: are you preventing denials before submission, or just reacting after they happen?"

**Bridge:** "Upstream complements Adonis—we detect behavioral drift 2-4 weeks **before** denials appear, so you can prevent them instead of recovering them. Some customers run both: Upstream for early warning, Adonis for real-time submission monitoring."

**Prove:** [NEEDS DATA - Case study of customer running both, or customer who switched and saw denial rate drop]

**Ask:** "How much of your denial management time is spent on prevention vs. recovery? What if you could catch issues weeks before they hit your A/R?"

---

### Objection #2: "Adonis integrates with our EHR—does Upstream?"

**Acknowledge:** "Adonis's EHR integration is a strength if you're on athenahealth, AdvancedMD, or eClinicalWorks."

**Reframe:** "That integration also means 3-6 month implementation timelines and EHR vendor dependencies. Upstream is EHR-independent **by design**—we connect via clearinghouse feeds or data uploads."

**Bridge:** "This gives you two advantages: (1) you go live in 30 days, not 3-6 months, and (2) we work with **any** EHR, not just the big three. Plus, for dialysis, ABA, imaging, and home health, the specialty-specific intelligence matters more than the login location."

**Prove:** "Our typical implementation is 30 days. Adonis's average is 3-6 months due to EHR vendor coordination."

**Ask:** "How long can you afford to wait for payer intelligence? And what's more important—embedding in your EHR, or having specialty-specific rules that actually prevent denials?"

---

### Objection #3: "What makes Upstream different from Adonis?"

**Acknowledge:** "Both provide payer intelligence, but the approach is fundamentally different."

**Reframe:** "Adonis tells you what's happening **now** (real-time alerts at submission). Upstream tells you what's **about to happen** (early-warning 2-4 weeks advance)."

**Bridge:** "For specialty practices like dialysis, ABA, imaging, and home health, early warning is critical because you can adjust coding, documentation, and workflows **before** claims go out. Adonis alerts you after submission—by then, it's too late to prevent the denial."

**Prove:** [NEEDS DATA - Example of early-warning alert that prevented $50k+ in denials, e.g., Medicare Advantage payment variance detected 3 weeks early]

**Ask:** "Are you in dialysis, ABA, imaging, or home health? If so, do you have specialty-specific intelligence for ESRD PPS, authorization tracking, prior auth patterns, or OASIS documentation? Adonis doesn't provide that—Upstream does."

---

### Objection #4: "Adonis gives us real-time alerts—does Upstream?"

**Acknowledge:** "Adonis's real-time alerts are strong—they catch issues within 24-48 hours of submission."

**Reframe:** "The trade-off is that by the time you get the alert, claims are already submitted. Upstream provides **early-warning** alerts 2-4 weeks **before** denials appear."

**Bridge:** "Think of it this way: Adonis is like a car alarm that goes off when someone breaks in. Upstream is like a security camera that alerts you when someone suspicious is walking toward your car. Both are valuable, but prevention is more cost-effective than recovery."

**Prove:** "90% of denials are preventable (industry stat). Upstream's early-warning detection gives you the time to prevent them. Adonis's real-time alerts help you recover them—but prevention is better than recovery."

**Ask:** "What would it be worth to your practice if you could prevent 30-50% of denials instead of recovering them after the fact?"

---

### Objection #5: "We don't want to switch—too much hassle"

**Acknowledge:** "Switching vendors can be disruptive, especially if Adonis is working reasonably well."

**Reframe:** "You don't have to 'rip and replace.' Upstream can run in parallel with Adonis during evaluation. And because we're EHR-independent, there's no integration project—just a data connection."

**Bridge:** "Implementation takes 30 days, and we provide a dedicated onboarding specialist. Many customers evaluate Upstream for 30-60 days while keeping Adonis, then decide whether to keep both (complementary) or consolidate to Upstream."

**Prove:** "Our implementation is 30 days start to finish. No EHR vendor coordination. No IT project. Just data connection + specialty rule configuration."

**Ask:** "What if we could be live in 30 days with zero disruption to your EHR workflows—would you be open to a 60-day pilot to see if early-warning detection catches issues Adonis misses?"

## Pricing Positioning

### How to Discuss Upstream's Value vs. Adonis's % Model

**Adonis Pricing:**
- Percentage-of-recovery model (10-15% of denied claims recovered, estimated)
- Variable monthly costs
- No published pricing (requires sales conversation)
- Unpredictable budgeting

**Upstream Pricing:**
- Fixed monthly subscription ($1,500-$3,500+ depending on practice size)
- Predictable annual costs
- Transparent published pricing
- Fixed cost regardless of denial volume

**Talking points:**
- "Adonis's percentage model means you pay more when denials are high—which feels backwards. Upstream's fixed fee means predictable budgeting."
- "CFOs love Upstream's pricing because they can budget accurately for the year. With Adonis, costs fluctuate month-to-month."
- "Upstream is typically 15-40% lower annual cost than Adonis, depending on practice size and denial volume."

### ROI Calculation Examples

**Small Dialysis Center (5-10 stations):**
- Upstream: $18,000/year (fixed)
- Adonis: ~$24,000-$42,000/year (estimated, variable)
- **Savings: $6,000-$24,000/year with Upstream**

**Medium ABA Clinic (15-25 BCBAs):**
- Upstream: $42,000/year (fixed)
- Adonis: ~$48,000-$72,000/year (estimated, variable)
- **Savings: $6,000-$30,000/year with Upstream**

**Value proposition:** "You save money **and** get early-warning prevention instead of reactive alerts."

## Discovery Questions

Use these questions to uncover pain points where Upstream wins vs. Adonis:

1. **"How long did Adonis take to implement?"**
   *(Listen for: 3-6 months, EHR integration delays, IT resource strain)*
   **Follow-up:** "What if you could go live in 30 days with no EHR vendor coordination?"

2. **"Are you in dialysis, ABA therapy, imaging, or home health?"**
   *(If yes, this is a high-confidence opportunity—specialty-specific intelligence is a killer differentiator)*
   **Follow-up:** "Does Adonis provide specialty-specific rules for [ESRD PPS/authorization tracking/prior auth patterns/OASIS documentation]?"

3. **"Do you know what percentage of recovery you're paying Adonis?"**
   *(Listen for: pricing opacity, budgeting frustration, variable costs)*
   **Follow-up:** "How would your CFO feel about transparent fixed monthly pricing?"

4. **"When you get an alert from Adonis, are the claims already submitted?"**
   *(Listen for: yes, real-time means post-submission)*
   **Follow-up:** "What if you got alerts 2-4 weeks **before** claims went out, so you could prevent denials instead of recovering them?"

5. **"What specialty-specific challenges are you facing with denials?"**
   *(Listen for: ESRD PPS changes, authorization expirations, prior auth pattern shifts, OASIS documentation issues)*
   **Follow-up:** "Does Adonis track those specialty-specific issues, or just general denial patterns?"

6. **"Are you on athenahealth, AdvancedMD, or eClinicalWorks?"**
   *(If no, Adonis doesn't support their EHR—Upstream is EHR-independent)*
   **Follow-up:** "Since Adonis doesn't support your EHR, how are you getting payer intelligence today?"

7. **"What's your current denial rate, and how much of it is preventable?"**
   *(Industry stat: 90% of denials are preventable)*
   **Follow-up:** "What if you could prevent 30-50% of those denials by catching behavioral drift weeks before submission?"

## When to Compete Aggressively

**High-confidence opportunities** where Upstream wins decisively:

✓ Dialysis centers needing ESRD PPS monitoring and Medicare Advantage variance tracking
✓ ABA therapy clinics frustrated with authorization expiration management
✓ Imaging centers needing prior authorization pattern detection and RBM integration
✓ Home health agencies needing OASIS documentation monitoring and PDGM compliance
✓ Practices on unsupported EHRs (not athenahealth/AdvancedMD/eCW)
✓ Practices needing fast implementation (under 60 days)
✓ CFOs/owners requiring transparent fixed pricing for board approval
✓ Practices frustrated with EHR integration delays from previous vendors

**Messaging:** "Upstream is built for your specialty with early-warning prevention and 30-day implementation."

---

## When to Concede (Or Don't Compete)

**Low-confidence opportunities** where Adonis may be a better fit:

✗ General specialty practices with no interest in dialysis/ABA/imaging/home health intelligence
✗ Practices deeply integrated with athenahealth/AdvancedMD/eCW and satisfied with Adonis
✗ Organizations requiring EHR-embedded solutions (will not use separate tools under any circumstances)
✗ Practices prioritizing real-time submission alerts over early-warning prevention
✗ Enterprise organizations with lengthy vendor vetting processes (Upstream is newer/less known)

**Concession language:** "Adonis is a strong fit for general specialty practices already on athenahealth, AdvancedMD, or eCW. Upstream is purpose-built for dialysis, ABA, imaging, and home health. If you're not in those verticals, Adonis may be a better match."

## Sales Strategy by Persona

### Billing Manager / Practice Administrator

**Pain points:**
- Overwhelmed with denial recovery work
- Frustrated with reactive (not proactive) tools
- Need simple, fast implementation

**Upstream pitch:**
- "Early-warning alerts let you prevent denials instead of spending all your time recovering them."
- "30-day implementation means you're live next month, not next quarter."
- "Specialty-specific rules for dialysis/ABA/imaging/home health actually prevent denials—not just flag them after submission."

### CFO / Financial Decision-Maker

**Pain points:**
- Need predictable budgeting
- Frustrated with variable percentage-based pricing
- Want ROI transparency

**Upstream pitch:**
- "Fixed monthly pricing means predictable annual budgets—no surprises."
- "Typically 15-40% lower annual cost than Adonis."
- "Quarterly business reviews for all customers (not just enterprise) to track ROI."

### Owner-Operator

**Pain points:**
- Want to focus on patients, not billing
- Frustrated with long vendor implementations
- Need simple, effective solutions

**Upstream pitch:**
- "Live in 30 days—no 6-month EHR integration project."
- "Prevent denials before they happen so you can focus on patient care, not A/R recovery."
- "Transparent pricing—no percentage-based fees that fluctuate."

## Key Takeaways for Sales Team

1. **Lead with specialty focus:** If the prospect is in dialysis, ABA, imaging, or home health, this is a high-confidence opportunity. Adonis doesn't provide vertical-specific intelligence.

2. **Emphasize prevention over recovery:** Adonis is reactive (real-time alerts after submission). Upstream is proactive (early-warning before submission).

3. **Highlight implementation speed:** 30 days vs. 3-6 months is a massive differentiator, especially for prospects frustrated with EHR integration delays.

4. **Use transparent pricing as a wedge:** CFOs love predictable budgeting. Adonis's percentage-based model creates uncertainty.

5. **Position as complementary (not replacement):** Some prospects will keep both—Upstream for early warning, Adonis for real-time alerts. This is a valid use case.

6. **Ask about EHR:** If they're not on athenahealth/AdvancedMD/eCW, Adonis doesn't work for them—Upstream does.

7. **Concede when appropriate:** General specialty practices already satisfied with Adonis and deeply integrated with supported EHRs are low-probability wins. Focus energy on dialysis/ABA/imaging/home health.
